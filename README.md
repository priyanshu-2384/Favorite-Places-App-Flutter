# favorite_places

A new Flutter project.

This project is an app in which you can save your favorite places, by clicking photo using your native device camera and getting its location using google maps.

1) I have used google maps api for accessing all maps related features.
2) Used flutter image_picker library for getting access to user's camera.
3) At the backend the data is store on user's device, Used SQL for storing data on the device.
3) And at last frontend is done purely in flutter.
